### Iteration 1: Prototype

**Deadline**: 27.4.2018

### Iteration 2: First draft

The second iteration aims already at the final goal & specification knowing that it is not possible to cover all topics yet. Still, it should be as functional as possbile to gather more detailed user feedback already.

**Deadline**: 29.6.2018

### Iteration 3: Final product

**Deadline**: 10.8.2018
