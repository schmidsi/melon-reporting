# Planning

![](../assets/Timeline - Projektplan v3.svg)

## Strategy

In a first step the foundation of the project is laid. Vision, hypothesis and boundaries are defined and agreed upon with the stakeholders and a rough planning is created. Furthermore repositories are created, docs initialized, etc.

**Deadline**: 13.4.2018

**Expected results**:

* Project vision
* Hypothesis
* Project boundaries
* Detail planning
* Basic setup of environment
* Documentation outline

## Research

The next step is to deep dive into the problem domain. We read and summarize the important articles about the topic and learn the underlying technologies. Also part of research are interviews.

**Deadline**: 20.4.2018

**Expected results**:

* Overview & summary of material: Articles, law, templates, ...
* Knowledge of underlying technologies (Blockchain, Solidity, React, Redux, digital signing, etc.)
* Transcripts of interviews

## Prototype

The collected knowledge from the research phase is now transformed into a first prototype which can be challenged by the stakeholders and test users.

**Deadline**: 27.4.2018

**Expected results**:

* Prototypes
* Wireframes

## Evaluate

Testing & discussing the prototype with the stakeholders and test users give us valuable insights for the further development.

**Deadline**: 22.6.2018

**Expected results**:

* Evaluation reports
* User testing reports

## Design

Already during the evaluation phase we start the design phase to have an iterative process: The prototype and wireframes are adjusted from the feedback but also the work on the final mockups and software architecture is started.

**Deadline 1**: 22.6.2018
**Deadline 2**: 27.7.2018

**Expected results**:

* Mockups
* Software Architecture
* Specifications

## Production

Iterative development and finishing a release candidate. This will also take place in combination with design and review phase. Basically in the following loop:
Design -> Production -> Review -> Design -> ...

**Deadline 1**: 29.6.2018
**Deadline 2**: 10.8.2018

**Expected results**:

* Final product first and second version

## Review

Collect feedback of the release candidate, finish documentation and submission of the thesis.

**Deadline**: 17.8.2018

**Expected results**:

* Review reports
* Final thesis report
