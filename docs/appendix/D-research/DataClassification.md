# Data Classification

## Reasoning

### CAP theorem
The Ethereum blockchain does not behave like a typical distributed data store in the classical sense. Nonetheless, we want to discuss the CAP theorem and its guarantees here.

#### Consistency
> Every read receives the most recent write or an error	

Regarding On-Chain data for the reports, this is not relevant. We generate reports in regards to a timespan. This means that we do not have to depend on values being the "most recent".

#### Availability
> Every request receives a (non-error) response â€“ without guarantee that it contains the most recent write

Again - with On-Chain data, we work with data retrieved from a timespan. Availability is not an issue.

#### Partition tolerance
> The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes

As every node in the blockchain eventually works with the same ledger, partition tolerance is not an issue.


### ACID

#### Atomicity

#### Consistency

#### Isolation

#### Durability

### Eventual consistency
[BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)

The Ethereum blockchain does NOT follow *eventual consistency*, but *strong consistency*.
