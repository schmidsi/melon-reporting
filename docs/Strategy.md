# Strategy

## Vision

From Mona:

> a) something that a real fund would be able to confidently be able to say - “this solves my reporting issues and makes my life a lot easier” - I’m willing to pilot test this

> b) something that can be show-cased to FINMA (and others) and show them how “this will make THEIR life over-seeing a lot easier”
