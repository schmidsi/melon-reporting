# Vision

Creating functionality on top of the Melon protocol that automates reporting/auditing almost completely:

> a) Something that a real fund manager would be able to confidently say: “This solves my reporting issues and makes my life a lot easier”

> b) Something that can be show-cased to FINMA (and other regulators) and show them how: "This will make _their_ life over-seeing a lot easier”
