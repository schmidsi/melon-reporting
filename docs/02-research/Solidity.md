# Solidity research

## Resources

### Solidity
[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) is a programming language for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. 

### Parity
[Parity](https://www.parity.io/) is a client to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy way to set up a development chain where we can test our own smart contracts without limitations.

### Web3.js
[Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html) is a JavaScript API for interacting with local or remote ethereum nodes. It enables us to develop clients which communicate with our smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Learnings
While learning *Solidity*, we created a cheatsheet to have a compact summary while developing our own smart contracts. The cheatsheet can be found in the appendix [Solidity cheatsheet](/08-appendix/Solidity.html).
