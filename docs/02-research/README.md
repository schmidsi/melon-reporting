# Research

Approach:

1.  Research & classify available data
2.  Research report types (KIID, PRIIPs, etc) and decompose into data requirements
3.  Consolidate different data requirements into a general [interchangeable fund data format (Github Issue #7)](https://github.com/melonproject/reporting-thesis/issues/7)
4.  Map available data to interchangeable fund data format.
