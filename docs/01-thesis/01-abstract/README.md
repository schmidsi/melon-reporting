# Abstract

> Melon is a fully decentralized asset management protocol which allows anyone to set up, manage and/or invest in an investment fund of digital assets in a secure, robust and permissionless manner. In three words: decentralized investment infrastructure.

Previous to this thesis, managers, investors, auditors and regulators of Melon funds did not have a reasonable tool to analyze how a fund is managed and how it performs. The _Reporting and Auditing_ module resolves this highly demanded part of Melon.

There are four crucial stakeholders, each with their own requirements on Reporting and Auditing:
* Fund managers are interested on performance and want to have hints on how to improve their trades
* Investors are interested in past management of a fund
* Auditors need to verify the integrity of the manager's work
* Regulators need to verify these audits

The final product contains the following parts:
* The _Report Data Extractor_ extracts all needed data to visualize a fund over a given timespan.
* The _Standard Report Web Interface_ visualizes this data in the form of a report which is of use for all stakeholders.
* The _Auditing Web App_ provides auditors with the ability to pass an opinion of a fund on a specific timespan which then can be verified by regulators.

Through successful explorative and validative user testings, the solution proves to be an effective tool which pleases all stakeholders.
