# Document organization

In the chapter _Background_ we have a closer look on how fund reporting is done traditionally.

In the chapter _Analyze_ we dissect what is expected from the _Auditing and Reporting_ module from the perspective of different stakeholders. Furthermore, we analyze the data that the Melon protocol provides and classify it.

In the chapter _Solution_ we dive into the architecture, design and implementation of all submodules.

In the chapter _Conclusion_ we reflect on the solution, summarize findings we achieved by the thesis and propose a list of future work on _Auditing and Reporting_ in Melon.
