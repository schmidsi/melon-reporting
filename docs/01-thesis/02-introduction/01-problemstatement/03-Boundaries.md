# Boundaries

## Legal

This is a technical thesis and therefore we do not deeply research into the legal aspects of fund management and reporting. But we will find ways how technology can support the legal processes.

## Technical

A lot of functionality of funds depends on third party modules: Price feeds, participation, exchanges. In this thesis, we only guarantee the official modules provided by Melonport. If modules outside of this scope could provide important functionality, we document this, but do not implement the necessary bridges.

We try to adapt to the latest Melon smart contracts but fall back to the last known working ones if the latest causing too much problem. Last known working version is [v0.7.0](https://github.com/melonproject/smart-contracts/tree/v0.7.0).
