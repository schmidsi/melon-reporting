# Method

## Prototype
The solution was built with an iterative approach. First of all, we analyzed how reporting and auditing is done traditionally and what data is available on- and off-chain to generate reports.

With a prototype, we were able to design the report and its underlying data as well as test the auditing procedure with a smart contract.
