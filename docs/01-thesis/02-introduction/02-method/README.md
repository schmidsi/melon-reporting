# Method

Due to the nature of tight time constraints in this thesis we opt for a mixed approach between iterative and waterfall project management:

- Plan 3 iterations
  - Every iteration shall have deliverables which we can use to collect feedback.
- Distribute feedback meetings with different stakeholders:
  - Every 3-4 weeks with the coaches
  - After each iteration with the client & coaches

The detailed project management & iteration planning is in the appendix:

- [Project Management](/02-appendices/B-projectmanagement/)
- [Iterations](/02-appendices/C-iterations/)

Here is a short overview over the iterations and deliverables:

## Prototype

Build something fast & simple to show to various stakeholders and gather feedback.

## First draft

Having a functional end to end prototype ready that touches all important parts.

## Final product

Iterate over the first draft to bring it to the final product that is submitted.
