## PRIIP

Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products

> A PRIIP is defined as: an investment where, regardless of its legal form, the amount repayable to the retail investor is subject to fluctuations because of exposure to reference values or to the performance of one or more assets that are not directly purchased by the retail investor; or an insurance-based investment product which offers a maturity or surrender value that is wholly or partially exposed, directly or indirectly, to market fluctuations.

> The aim of the [PRIIPs Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R1286&from=EN) is to encourage efficient EU markets by helping investors to better understand and compare the key features, risk, rewards and costs of different PRIIPs, through access to a short and consumer-friendly Key Information Document (KID). How information in the KID should be calculated and presented is set out in the [PRIIPs Regulatory Technical Standards (RTSs)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1516899203728&uri=CELEX:02017R0653-20170412).

## SRRI

> The synthetic risk and reward indicator (SRRI) is used to classify investment funds into one of three different risk categories (low risk, medium risk, high risk). It is calculated on the basis of Austrian and European regulatory requirements. This indicator forms an integral part of the Key Investor Information Document (KIID) and gives the historical volatility of the fund unit price on a scale from 1 to 7.

| SRRI | Risk category | Volatility intervals |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | Low risk      | 0% to <0.5%          |
| 2    |               | ≥0.5% to <2.0%       |
| 3    | Medium risk   | ≥2.0% to <5.0%       |
| 4    |               | ≥5.0% to <10.0%      |
| 5    |               | ≥10.0% to <15.0%     |
| 6    |               | ≥15.0% to <25.0%     |
| 7    | High risk     | ≥25.0%               |
